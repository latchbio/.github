  </h3>
</html>

Latch is a modular and programmable data infrastructure designed to orchestrate diverse scientific teams for faster biological consensus. 

These are the components:

- [Plots](https://wiki.latch.bio/plots/overview)
- [Registry](https://wiki.latch.bio/registry/what-is-a-registry)
- [Workflows](https://wiki.latch.bio/workflows/overview), including support for Nextflow, Snakemake and a Python SDK
- [Pods](https://wiki.latch.bio/pods/overview)
- [Data](https://wiki.latch.bio/data/overview)
- [Compliance / streamlined IND filing](https://trust.latch.bio/)
