#### Why the LatchBio SDK

The previous generation of bioinformatics frameworks, eg. nextflow, Snakemake,
WDL, etc., are difficult to develop with, use outdated languages, and lack
features needed in a modern software framework.

The [LatchBio SDK](github.com/latchbio/latch) is a workflow description language
built with an emphasis on developer ergonomics and the following
mission-critical features:

- No-code [interface generation](https://docs.latch.bio/basics/customizing_interface.html) and hosting
- [Strong typing](https://docs.latch.bio/basics/parameter_types.html) of parameters
- Serverless [cloud deployments](https://docs.latch.bio/basics/defining_cloud_resources.html)
- Baked-in versioning + [containerization](https://docs.latch.bio/basics/writing_dockerfiles.html)
- Auditable data + execution lineage
- First-class python support (with integration for arbitrary languages)

### Latch Verified

[Latch Verified](https://github.com/latch-verified) is a set of curated
bioinformatics workflows built using the SDK. Check out source code and
documentation at the linked repository.
